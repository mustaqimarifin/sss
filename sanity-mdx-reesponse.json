This goal prompted me to step back and reassess how I consume media online.\n\n## The Old Way\n\nMy old process consisted of two main sources: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). I'm sure most people know what Reddit is by now, given that it's the 3rd most visited website in the US. Hacker News is a stripped back Reddit-like aggregator ran by [Y Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) specifically targeted at the tech industry. Users can upvote interesting content which makes it more discoverable to others. Simple as that.\n\nI'd check these websites daily, reading various subreddits and diving deep in comment threads. It had worked pretty well. However, I saw a couple places for improvements.\n\n- There was no shared history across both sources. Sure, Reddit has a view history and HN has an upvote history, but there's no single source of truth. This problem exacerbates itself when adding another source into the mix (e.g. NY Times).\n- My bookmarks were flooded with articles I wanted to save forever or read later. This list was starting to get out of hand (and again, not a single source of truth).\n- I wanted to consume more content sources, specifically news sites, without having to check 4-5 websites daily.\n- Lots of news sites have poorly designed interfaces filled with cruft. Your adblocker can only do so much. It doesn't surpass a paywall or improve the page layout.\n\n## The New Way\n\nI was able to solve the aforementioned issues using a combination of Feedly and Instapaper. Let's talk about these both individually.\n\n### Feedly\n\n<DickPics alt={`Feedly`} src={`hahaha/feedly.png`} width={2136} height={1178} />\n\n[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is essentially a news aggregator. You are able to combine multiple content sources together by subscribing to [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds. This saves you time by not having to visit all the sites individually.\n\nYour feeds can be organized into different channels (e.g. dev, news, people, life). Feedly can then determine which articles are the most popular and narrow down your firehose of information. Once I've found an article I want to read, I'll send it over to Instapaper.\n\n_Side note: Thanks to Rands for [suggesting the use of Feedly](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/rands-information-practices/)._\n\n### Instapaper\n\n<DickPics\n  alt={`Instapaper`}\n  src={`hahaha/instapaper.png`}\n  width={1774}\n  height={1152}\n/>\n\n[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) is a simple tool for saving web pages to read later on your phone or computer. It removes the superfluous content of websites and presents the article in an elegant, digestible form.\n\nOn top of that, with Instapaper you have the ability to read articles offline, keeping track of your position in the article across devices. There's even a time estimate for reading the article. Really helpful stuff.\n\nThe killer feature for me is having a single source of truth. Now, I have an archived history of all articles I've read, as well as one referencable place for my favorites. No more bookmarks mess. No more fragmentation. Hello, efficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis new process has been working great for me, but I'm curious to hear what others do. If you have any suggestions or improvements, let me know! There are a variety of similar products out there (e.g. [Feeder](https://feeder.co/) and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)). Leave me a comment if this article was helpful and has you reconsidering how you consume media online.\n\nCheers! 🎉\n",

      "content": "\nLast year, I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) on a mission to grow the Next.js community. Today, I'm excited to announce **I've been** **promoted to Head of Developer Relations at Vercel**. I want to share how I got here, my plans for the future, and invite you to [join the team](https://vercel.com/careers).\n\n## My Path Towards Developer Relations\n\nI've always enjoyed the intersection of design, development, product management, marketing, and even sales. It stems from entrepreneurial roots. However, this desire to work across many parts of the business often came across as indecisiveness in my career.\n\nThat was three years ago – around the same time I began using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I didn't know what [Developer Relations](https://emilyfreeman.io/blog/developer-relations-more-than-the-art-of-talking-good) was at the time. However, I did know I wanted to create. I wanted to write, record, stream, post, tweet, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers. This realization led to me becoming a creator and helping others learn to program.\n\nAfter teaching over 100,000 developers from around the world, I joined the team at Vercel.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1303849673141243905\" />\n\n## It’s all about community. In realtime.\n\nAt Vercel, we're [relentlessly focused](https://rauchg.com/2020/next-for-vercel#frontend-focus) on improving the Developer Experience of building for the web. This means changes like making `next dev` [start 24% faster](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2), refreshing changes [200ms quicker](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-1), and including [zero-config solutions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10) to improve performance.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1387420270646943746\" />\n\nWe want to make development a [collaborative, real-time experience](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1378086219708473344) accessible to everyone. By providing close integrations to your [database](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1351576575888797696), CMS, or other services, we aim to make it as easy as possible to build modern web apps.\n\nNext.js is growing quickly with over [1.3 million installations per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next). Recent releases [10.0](http://nextjs.org/10), [10.1](https://nextjs.org/10-1), and [10.2](https://nextjs.org/10-2) have added features to help improve performance, while simplifying and speeding up the development process. **But we're just getting started.**\n\nYesterday, we announced a special edition of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf) on June 15th, where we'll be unveiling some new features you don't want to miss. If you were one of the 40,000 attendees last year, you'll have the option to select an exclusive silver ticket. There's also one more VIP gold ticket which I won't explain just yet 🤐\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1394749422194528263\" />\n\n## Join Me\n\nI'm equally excited to announce we're growing our team with three roles:\n\n- [Developer Advocate](https://vercel.com/careers) – Educate on the latest Next.js features, craft high-quality examples and demos, engage with our community, write documentation, and advocate for a faster web. This role will work closely with myself, Marketing, Product, and our CEO.\n- [Field Engineer / Solutions Architect](https://vercel.com/careers) – Work with our sales team to provide solutions to customer's needs. You have a deep understanding of building large-scale applications, understanding technical requirements, and discussing tradeoffs. USA only (UTC −4 to -8). This was my previous role, highly recommended. Send me a message if you want to learn more.\n- [Community Manager](https://vercel.com/careers) – Engage our community across platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Discord, StackOverflow, and more! Ensure our user's needs are met and help gather customer feedback.\n\nI’m the most energized and optimistic I’ve ever been in my 10 years as a developer. We're building a truly world-class team of folks at Vercel. If you want to join a high-growth startup, scale a community with millions of developers, and transform the way we build the web – join me!\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported me. To say I am humbled and grateful would be an understatement. I'd also like to thank the 1,500+ open-source contributors and the incredible work of the Next.js core team, as well as our partners on the Google Chrome team and the React team at Facebook for helping improve Next.js.\n\n<ImageWithTheme\n  alt={`Next.js Contributors`}\n  light={`/static/images/devrel/light.png`}\n  dark={`/static/images/devrel/dark.png`}\n  width={1850 / 2}\n  height={1360 / 2}\n/>\n\nFinally, I want to thank [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinvangundy) and [Hank](https://twitter.com/thehanktaylor) for helping me grow in my role at Vercel – and [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/rauchg) for steering the ship with impressive attention to detail and quality.\n",
